### A Little About Me / My Story

&ensp;Ever since I was young, I always had an interest in science and mathematics. Everywhere I looked, I wanted to figure out how it worked or how to replicate it. I would take apart my toys and try to understand how they worked. As I was growing up, I was constantly surrounded by creative people. My mother, father, and uncle were all aspiring artists at the time, and they taught me how to draw. I would always draw things relating to science, such as space or mechanical contraptions. When I was around eight, my father let me play games on his computer. I found particular interest in the game ‚ÄúSpore‚Äù, by Maxis and EA. Spore is a space simulation game where you are able to make creatures and evolve them. Whenever I played the game, I was constantly wondering how they were able to animate unique, user-created creatures with mathematics. This is what sparked my interest in programming. I wanted to create software that captivates people.

&ensp;Programming captivates me because it allows me to do anything I could possibly think of. I can make games, apps, scientific models, art, and much more. I enjoy challenging myself daily with a new set of problems. Each day, when I am developing my projects, I learn something new. I constantly want to learn more, and there are a seemingly infinite number of resources for me to learn from. When I want to learn more about something, I look on the internet for books, papers, and articles relating to the topic I want to learn. While I am studying, I create projects to apply my knowledge and get a deeper understanding of the topic. If I cannot find or understand something, I have plenty of friends who are also programmers that may be more knowledgeable in a certain area than I am.

&ensp;When I was nine, I started developing projects that I would find from YouTube videos or guides online. At the age of twelve, after giving up multiple times, I started developing a game called ‚ÄúProject Unknown‚Äù to grow my independence from tutorials and familiarize myself with programming and problem-solving. Going from my little projects to making this game is comparable to going from swimming in a kiddie pool to diving headfirst into the deep end. Project Unknown was a low-poly space simulation game where the scene is a procedural, seamless solar system. This was a very complex beginner project, and it was meant to be that way. I wanted to give myself a challenge so I could fully understand basic programming. After I lost the project files of the game, I decided I wanted to dive deeper into software development, and not just game development. I decided I wanted to make a game engine from scratch. I learned basic three-dimensional math along the way, and I was able to make an engine for me to develop my game in. While I was developing this program, I learned software and graphics programming fundamentals that I use everyday.
    
&ensp;I stepped away from game development for a while, as I wanted to dive into more technical things. I did not want to use software other people made to create bland, seamless planets for space games. I wanted to make better, seamless, intuitive, high performance, high scalability environments. Currently, I am developing a full-scale GPU-driven planet generation toolkit inside of Unreal Engine for artists and graphics programmers using my own theories and concepts that I engineered due to lack of public research. I named the plug-in "EXOSKY Planets." The plugin is current a heavy work-in-progress, but I am posting frequent updates on my Discord, YouTube, and ArtStation.
