### A Litte About Me / My Story

&ensp;Ever since I was little, I was always interested in mathematics. I always wanted to figure out how everything works.
I would look at the night sky or photos of space and just wonder. I would obsess over learning and growing my understanding
of how our universe works.

&ensp;At the age of nine, I discovered computer programming, and I obsessed over learning it.
I started out in Unreal Engine, making small games from youtube tutorials.
Over the course of a couple years, I would slowly grow my understanding of how computer programming works.
To gain experience and knowlege in this area, I decided I wanted to develop a space simulation game.

&ensp;To start this journey, I used Discord, which is a popular gaming community service. I joined many communities to learn programming and
met very talented people along the way. Without them, none of this could have been done. They provided me with resources and a lot of help.
I made a game called "Project Unknown", and it was a low-poly space game. I used Unreal Engine with the plug-in called "Voxel Plugin" to make planets.
I used Blender to 3D model objects for the game. All of the project's history is available on my YouTube channel. I do not
have any of the content or project files for the game, because my hard drive died. I figured, if I want to start again, why not do it right?

&ensp;In 2020, I started developing my own CPU-based planetary generation system for Unreal Engine 4. Due to request, I made it a product for people to use.
After the difficulties with ease of use and other people using something designed specifically around my needs, I decided to remake the entire system.
I developed a GPU-based planetary generation system, using the Unreal Engine Material Graph and C++. I named the plug-in "Unreal Planets Plugin"
It is currently still a HEAVY work-in-progress, but you can join my discord server to follow updates. 

As of October 2023, I senior in high school.
